# React Pizza Store 🍕 🍕 🍕

A simple front-end pizza store built using React, Semantic UI React and a dash of Stripe Elements. . [View demo]().

## Features ✨

* ** HomePage** - A simple home page with logo and placeholder where one (Customer) csn enter the name and good to go.
* **Shopping cart** - see and edit your order.
* **Checkout page** - for the purposes of this demo website, you can click on 'Fill with fake customer' to populate fields. Stripe Elements was used to create the Payment section's UI (unfortunately pre-filling info is a big no-no here), but clicking 'Use test card' will pop up a modal with details from a test card that you can copy & use.
* **Order confirmation page** displays customer's first name and a button to start the fun all over again.
